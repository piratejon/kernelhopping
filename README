Here is the idea:
# git clone
# ./do_kernel_hopping

When finished this will download the latest kernel and compile and install it and then reboot and then check once a day for new kernels and download, compile, install, reboot, etc.

I hope I don't need to add that this is not meant to be a serious tool!

Codename

turbo-octo-dangerzone, easily the awesomest inspirational name github has ever recommended me!
